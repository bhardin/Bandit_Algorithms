# Bandit Algorithms

I've been reading [Bandit Algorithms for Website Optimization](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027393.do) and was disappointed that all the examples are in Python. To further my understanding I reimplemented many of the examples given, but in Ruby.

## Running

    ruby test_bandit_algorithm

## Notes

`test_bandit_algorithm.rb` is the only file that needs to be messed with. This file handles the creation of your algorithm and running it through a test suite.
